  <div><p>Directions: The Rules are simple.  To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. Take turns clicking across the top row of the board to place your piece.</p></div>
